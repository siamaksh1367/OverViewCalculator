Hi and thanks again for inviting me to this challenge.

From the way that I understood this assessment is testing the ability to design a system and how a developerwould see different entities and workflow during the lifetime of a product

The other is the way that the developer would make the code extensible and maintainable

So based on these considerations I have something to mention here.

This is not something that can be used in production because:
1. It is open to everybody to access
2. It does not provide any mechanism for logging and exception handling 
3. It is not a reliable code because it does not have any unit or integration or end to end tests. However, it is built upon best practices as a testable code.
4. I was and still am a bit new to the mathematical calculation in this module. So, I just tried to look them up. But at the end of the day, it sounds like something not very clear to me. But I can learn easily by working in the team

So I use several links to be able to find relevant formula that I'm gonna list below :
	a. https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/mortgage-calculator.aspx
		To get an understanding of calculating the monthly payment 
	b. https://www.calculator.net/apr-calculator.html?cloanamount=500000&cloanterm=10&cloantermmonth=0&cinterestrate=5&ccompound=monthly&cpayback=month&cloanedfees=0&cfrontfees=5000&type=1&x=99&y=14#generalapr
		To play around a little bit with different numbers and values to understand what it is basically about
	c. https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/how-to-calculate-apr
		To get to know more about the APR. 
		This one was the most tricky. I could not manage to generate the same number as the one shows in the previous link.
		But I decided to not do anything about it because I believe, this is somehow the business domain which I will learn gradually 

At the end I hope you find it as a proper solution for this challenge, and I'm looking forward to hearing your feedback soon.
